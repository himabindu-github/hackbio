# Stage-0 task
- This is the first task of Hackbio's Biocoding Internship.
- A team of 5 was formed, and they will continue to work on the tasks together.

## The task
Use any data structure of your choice to organize the following information
- Your names
- Your Slack username
- Your email address
- Your hobbies
- Your countries of origin
- Your preferred programming language

## What I did
Used R programming language to perform the task.
- The plan is to organize the data in a structured table format
- The columns will contain the details/values(names, slack_names, email address etc.)
- A data frame 'task_stage0' is created using the R function data.frame()
- Vectors containing sequences of names, slack usernames, email ids, hobbies etc were created using the c() function. 
- The created vectors form columns and a name is provided to each column.
- data.frame() combines the vectors into a data frame.
- The output is printed using print() function.
